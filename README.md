# qFlow - Workflow Portlets
Portlets for workflow functionality containing the workflow admin panel and the workflow monitor. The underlying functionality is based on the Workflow API.

## Workflow Admin Panel
This portlet provides functionality to configure implemented (gUSE) workflows by specifying workflow metadata, connected openBIS types and parameters which should be shown to the users.

## Workflow Monitor
This portlet shows information about submitted workflows such as the current status and the connected openBIS experiment instance. Currently it only supports gUSE workflows.
